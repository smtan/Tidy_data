 Codebook for Human Activity Recognition data cleanupâ€“ Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data


Subject.ID (1st column of dataset):

	ID of 30 volunteers for the activity analysis experiment
 	Integer 1 to 30


Activity.labels (2nd column of dataset):

	List of the 6 types of activities of data type character recorded during the experiment:

		Walking
		Walking_upstairs
		Walking_downstairs
		Sitting
		Standing
		Laying

		Each individual volunteer subject will perform all 6 of these activities. Hence there will be a total of
		180 (30 x 6) observations.


Measurements of activity signal column variables (all subsequent column of dataset):

	81 types of activity signals as column variables of data type numeric in the summary table (column data) of analysis. 
	The measurement signal values have been normalised between -1 and +1. X# at the beginning of each variable name denotes 
	identifier from the original larger dataset (see sample of final data at the end of this codebook).

		These measurement signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
		'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

		tBodyAcc-XYZ
		tGravityAcc-XYZ
		tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
		tBodyGyro-XYZ
		tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
		tBodyAccMag
		tGravityAccMag
		tBodyAccJerkMag
		tBodyGyroMag
		tBodyGyroJerkMag
		fBodyAcc-XYZ
		fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
		fBodyGyro-XYZ
		fBodyAccMag
		fBodyAccJerkMag
		fBodyGyroMag
		fBodyGyroJerkMag

		The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

		mean(): Mean value
		std(): Standard deviation
		meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
		angle(): Angle between to vectors.

		Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are 
		used on the angle() variable:

		gravityMean
		tBodyAccMean
		tBodyAccJerkMean
		tBodyGyroMean
		tBodyGyroJerkMean

Transformation from the original files:

	All original relevant raw files are downloaded into a working directory from which the data cleaning and transformation 
	are done. (url link for download of raw file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

	The 2 original raw files from the experiment consist of activity signal measurements for some volunteer subjects 
	participating in "training" and the rest in "test". The total number of volunteer subjects is 30 as mentioned 
	previously. Each of these 2 files are merged with their respective subject ID and activity list (walking, standing...)
	information and appended with the measurement signal variable names for the columns. 

	As we are interested only in the mean and standard deviation measurements of activity signal variables in their 
	respective columns, the rest of the columns of variables are filtered off. The 2 transformed files are then merged 
	to form a combined intermediate file. Using ddply function from the plyr library, a second, independent tidy data 
	set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is created. This is output as summary.txt.

	For reference, the code for the final calculation is:
	> summary.data <- ddply(combine, .(Subject.ID, Activity.labels), colwise(mean))

	where "combine" is the merged dataset prior to the final transformation to obtain the required average values for each
	activity and subject.



The final Data file:
	
 	This is stored as summary.txt in the same working directory. When downloaded and read with an appropriate program, there are 180 
	rows or observations and 81 columns of variables (described above). 
	


Notes: 
======
The instruction for this assignment states that the final output file should be in .txt format,  and this is done in the last line of
the R script. However, this format cannot be legibly read when using the usual WORD or NOTEPAD programs unless using R or RStudio 
read.table function. Hence a sample outout of this file is produced here for easy reference of the "tidiness" of the dataset 
(using read.table function):
